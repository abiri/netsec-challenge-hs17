# Hacking Lab Challenge HS17

This code is based on work by Ramon Fontes from the University of Campinas, Brazil.

The project shows how the KRACK attack can be performed on a Mininet network in a Virtual machine. For the project, we used the current Kali VM 10.16 from Compass Security.

For information on how to install the provided software and test its functionality, we refer to the README found in the subfolder `/mininet-wifi/krack-2017`. The report describes the challenge and its implementation in further detail.
